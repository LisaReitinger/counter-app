## Design Choices

### Colors
- **Background:** Soft purple (`#d3b5ea`) for a calming, modern look.
- **Container:** White for high contrast and readability.
- **Buttons:**
  - **Increment:** Green (`#129e30`) to indicate a positive action.
  - **Decrement:** Red (`#e00000`) to indicate a negative action.
  - **Reset:** Purple (`#a084ca`) to match the theme and stand out as a neutral action.

### Fonts
- **Font Family:** Arial, sans-serif for clarity and wide compatibility.
- **Font Size:** Large, bold fonts for accessibility and easy reading on all devices.

### Layout
- **Centered container:** Uses Flexbox to center the app both vertically and horizontally.
- **Responsive design:** The layout adapts to different screen sizes, keeping the app usable and visually appealing on mobile and desktop.
- **Button group:** Buttons are placed in a row for easy access and clear separation of actions. On very small screens, horizontal scrolling is enabled to maintain button size and usability.
